I led a 7-member team in developing a website for a UK hospital within a tight Â£95,000 budget and a 12-week timeframe, prioritizing essential features. My responsibilities encompassed gathering requirements, crafting user stories, mapping processes, designing wireframes, and organizing sprints using agile methodology. Our collaborative efforts aimed to enhance convenience for both patients and healthcare providers while boosting revenue generation, process efficiency, service quality, and business visibility.
